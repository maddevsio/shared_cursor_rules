# Gitflow Workflow Rules

## Main Branches

### main / master / production
- Contains production-ready code
- Never commit directly to main

### develop / staging
- Main development branch
- Contains latest delivered development changes
- Source branch for feature branches
- Never commit directly to develop

## Supporting Branches

### feature/*
- Branch from: develop
- Merge back into: develop
- Naming convention: feature/[issue-id]-descriptive-name
- Example: feature/JIRA-123-user-authentication
- Must be up-to-date with develop before creating PR
- Delete after merge

### hotfix/*
- Branch from: main
- Merge back into:
  - main
  - develop
- Naming convention: hotfix/vX.Y.Z
- Example: hotfix/v1.2.1
- Only for urgent production fixes
- Delete after merge

## Commit Messages

- Format: `issue-id - type(scope): description`
- Types:
  - JIRA-123 - feature: New feature
  - JIRA-123 - fix: Bug fix
  - JIRA-123 - docs: Documentation changes
  - JIRA-123 - style: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
  - JIRA-123 - refactor: Code refactoring
  - JIRA-123 - test: Adding tests
  - JIRA-123 - chore: Maintenance tasks

## Version Control

### Semantic Versioning
- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes (1.4 -> 2.0)
- MINOR version for backwards-compatible functionality (1.4 -> 1.5)
- PATCH version for backwards-compatible bug fixes (1.4 -> 1.4.1)

## Pull Request Rules

1. All changes must go through Pull Requests
2. Required approvals: minimum 1
3. CI checks must pass
4. No direct commits to protected branches (main, develop)
5. Branch must be up to date before merging
6. Delete branch after merge

## Branch Protection Rules

### main & develop
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Include administrators in restrictions
- No force pushes
- No deletions

## Hotfix Process

1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Fix the issue
3. Bump patch version
4. Create PR to main
5. After merge to main:
   - Tag release
   - Merge back to develop
   - Delete hotfix branch
