Help me integrate GitHub OAuth into my [TECH_STACK] application for developer authentication.

Project context:

- Tech stack: [XXX]
- Development environment: [YYY]
- Integration purpose: Allow developers to sign in with their GitHub accounts

What I need:

1. GitHub OAuth App setup and configuration
2. OAuth flow implementation (authorization code flow)
3. User profile and repository access
4. Token management and refresh handling
5. Scope management for different permission levels
6. Integration with existing user system

Additional requirements:

- Access to user's repositories and organizations
- GitHub API integration for fetching user data

- Error handling for OAuth failures

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
