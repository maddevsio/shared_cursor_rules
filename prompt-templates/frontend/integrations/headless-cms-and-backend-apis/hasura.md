I need to integrate Hasura for instant GraphQL APIs and real-time features. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Database: [PostgreSQL, existing database, microservices integration]
- Frontend: [React + Apollo, Vue.js + GraphQL, Next.js, mobile app]
- Authentication: [JWT, webhook auth, custom auth service]
- Authorization: [role-based permissions, row-level security, dynamic rules]
- Real-time: [subscriptions, live queries, collaborative features]
- Custom logic: [Actions, Event Triggers, Remote Schemas]
- Deployment: [Hasura Cloud, self-hosted, Docker, Kubernetes]
- Integration: [existing APIs, third-party services, microservices]

What I need:

1. Hasura setup and database connection
2. GraphQL schema generation and customization
3. Authentication and JWT configuration
4. Authorization rules and permission system
5. Real-time subscriptions implementation
6. Actions for custom business logic
7. Event Triggers for automated workflows
8. Remote Schema integration
9. GraphQL client setup and optimizations
10. Production deployment and monitoring

Additional context: [database complexity, authorization requirements, real-time needs, existing infrastructure]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
