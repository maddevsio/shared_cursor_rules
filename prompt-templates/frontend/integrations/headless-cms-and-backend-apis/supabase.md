I need to integrate Supabase for PostgreSQL-based backend services. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Application type: [web app, mobile app, SaaS, real-time dashboard]
- Database needs: [relational data, complex queries, full-text search]
- Authentication: [email/password, OAuth, magic links, row-level security]
- Real-time features: [live updates, subscriptions, collaborative features]
- Storage requirements: [file uploads, image processing, CDN delivery]
- API approach: [auto-generated REST, real-time subscriptions, custom functions]
- Security: [RLS policies, JWT handling, API key management]
- Deployment: [hosted Supabase, self-hosted, edge functions]

What I need:

1. Supabase project setup and database schema design
2. JavaScript client configuration and TypeScript types
3. Authentication implementation with RLS policies
4. Database queries and relationship management
5. Real-time subscriptions and live data updates
6. File storage and upload functionality
7. Edge Functions for custom server logic
8. Row-level security policy implementation
9. Database migrations and version control
10. Performance optimization and query analysis

Additional context: [data complexity, security requirements, scalability needs, real-time features]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
