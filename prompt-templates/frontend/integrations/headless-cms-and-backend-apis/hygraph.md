I need to integrate Hygraph for GraphQL-based content management. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Frontend stack: [React + Apollo, Vue.js + GraphQL, Next.js, Gatsby]
- Content modeling: [hierarchical content, relations, content federation]
- GraphQL setup: [queries, mutations, subscriptions, fragments]
- Rich text: [structured content, custom renderers, embedded assets]
- Localization: [multi-region content, translation management]
- Media management: [asset transformations, responsive images, video]
- Real-time: [live updates, collaborative editing, webhooks]
- Permissions: [content roles, API access, editorial workflow]

What I need:

1. Hygraph project setup and schema design
2. GraphQL client configuration (Apollo/Relay)
3. Content queries and data fetching strategies
4. Rich text rendering with custom components
5. Asset management and image transformations
6. Real-time updates and subscription setup
7. Localization and multi-region content
8. Authentication and permission management
9. Webhook integration for content changes
10. Performance optimization and caching

Additional context: [GraphQL experience, content complexity, real-time requirements, team workflow]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
