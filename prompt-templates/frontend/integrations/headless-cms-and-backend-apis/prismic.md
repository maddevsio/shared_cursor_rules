I need to integrate Prismic for slice-based content management. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Framework: [React, Vue.js, Next.js, Nuxt.js, Gatsby, vanilla JavaScript]
- Content approach: [page builder, blog, marketing site, component library]
- Slice Machine: [custom slices, reusable components, design system]
- Rich text: [structured content, custom serializers, embedded content]
- Preview: [draft content, A/B testing, scheduled publishing]
- Localization: [multi-language, content variants, translation workflow]
- SEO: [meta tags, structured data, URL structure]
- Performance: [static generation, incremental builds, image optimization]

What I need:

1. Prismic repository setup and slice configuration
2. Slice Machine integration and custom slice development
3. JavaScript client setup and API queries
4. Rich text rendering with custom components
5. Preview mode and draft content handling
6. Page routing and dynamic URL generation
7. SEO optimization and meta tag management
8. Image optimization and responsive delivery
9. Localization setup and content variants
10. Static site generation and build optimization

Additional context: [design system requirements, content structure, performance goals, editorial workflow]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
