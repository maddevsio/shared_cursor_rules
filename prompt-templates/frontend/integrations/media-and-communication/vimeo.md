I need to integrate Vimeo API for video hosting and playback. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Tech stack: [e.g., React + Node.js, Vue.js, static site, etc.]
- Vimeo features: [video hosting, custom player, video management, analytics]
- Upload method: [direct upload, tus resumable, server-side processing]
- Player customization: [branded player, custom controls, responsive design]
- Content organization: [folders, showcases, collections, privacy settings]
- User interaction: [comments, likes, social features, embedding]
- Video quality: [adaptive streaming, multiple resolutions, compression]
- Commercial needs: [white-label solution, no Vimeo branding, advanced features]

What I need:

1. Vimeo Developer App setup and authentication
2. Video upload implementation (tus protocol)
3. Vimeo Player SDK integration
4. Video management API (metadata, privacy, organization)
5. Custom player styling and branding
6. Analytics and engagement tracking
7. Advanced features (password protection, domain restrictions)
8. Responsive embedding and mobile optimization
9. Webhook integration for video processing events
10. Performance optimization and CDN delivery

Additional context: [video volume, quality requirements, branding needs, existing video infrastructure]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
