I need to integrate Cloudflare Turnstile for bot protection and CAPTCHA alternative. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Tech stack: [e.g., React + Node.js, Vue.js + Express, static site, etc.]
- Protection scope: [forms, API endpoints, user registration, login, comments]
- User experience: [invisible challenge, explicit challenge, managed challenge]
- Implementation: [client-side rendering, server-side rendering, SPA, static sites]
- Backend validation: [Node.js, PHP, Python, Go, serverless functions]
- Form types: [contact forms, registration, login, checkout, comments]
- Styling: [custom themes, responsive design, accessibility compliance]

What I need:

1. Cloudflare Turnstile site setup and site key configuration
2. Client-side widget implementation and styling
3. Server-side token validation setup
4. React/Vue component integration
5. Form submission handling with Turnstile validation
6. Error handling and fallback mechanisms
7. Custom styling and theme configuration
8. Accessibility compliance implementation
9. Analytics and challenge success tracking
10. Multiple form types integration

Additional context: [expected traffic volume, form complexity, accessibility requirements, existing security measures]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
