I need to integrate Datadog RUM for real user monitoring and performance tracking. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Tech stack: [e.g., React + Node.js, Next.js, Vue.js, Angular, etc.]
- Monitoring scope: [page performance, user interactions, API calls, errors]
- Performance metrics: [Core Web Vitals, custom metrics, business KPIs]
- User tracking: [user sessions, conversion funnels, feature adoption]
- Error tracking: [JavaScript errors, network failures, custom events]
- Session replay: [user interactions, console logs, network requests]
- Infrastructure: [CDN usage, multiple environments, geographic distribution]

What I need:

1. Datadog RUM application setup and client token configuration
2. Browser SDK installation and initialization
3. Custom action and error tracking implementation
4. Performance monitoring for Core Web Vitals
5. User session tracking and identification
6. Custom attributes and global context setup
7. Session replay configuration and privacy settings
8. Error tracking and custom error handling
9. Custom dashboards and alerting rules
10. Integration with Datadog APM and infrastructure monitoring

Additional context: [application scale, performance requirements, compliance needs, existing Datadog setup]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
