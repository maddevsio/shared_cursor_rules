I need to integrate Bugsnag for application stability monitoring. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Tech stack: [e.g., React + Node.js, Angular + Express, mobile app, etc.]
- Error tracking: [unhandled exceptions, custom errors, network failures, crash reports]
- Performance monitoring: [app launch times, network requests, custom metrics]
- Release stages: [development, staging, production, feature flags]
- User tracking: [user context, custom metadata, breadcrumbs]
- Team workflow: [notification channels, escalation rules, issue assignment]
- Platform coverage: [web, mobile, server-side, multiple environments]

What I need:

1. Bugsnag project setup and API key configuration
2. JavaScript notifier installation and setup
3. Error handling middleware for backend services
4. User context and custom metadata implementation
5. Breadcrumb tracking for user journey analysis
6. Performance monitoring setup and custom metrics
7. Release tracking and version management
8. Team notifications and Slack/email integration
9. Custom error filtering and ignore rules
10. Dashboard setup for stability monitoring

Additional context: [application complexity, user base size, critical error scenarios, existing tools integration]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
