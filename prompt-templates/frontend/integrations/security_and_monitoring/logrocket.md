I need to integrate LogRocket for session replay and user experience monitoring. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Tech stack: [e.g., React + Redux, Vue.js + Vuex, Angular + NgRx, etc.]
- Session replay: [user interactions, DOM changes, console logs, network requests]
- Performance monitoring: [page load times, Core Web Vitals, custom metrics]
- State management: [Redux, Vuex, MobX, Zustand integration]
- Privacy requirements: [PII sanitization, GDPR compliance, data retention]
- User identification: [authenticated users, anonymous tracking, custom properties]
- Integration needs: [error tracking tools, analytics platforms, support systems]

What I need:

1. LogRocket project setup and app ID configuration
2. JavaScript SDK installation and initialization
3. Redux/Vuex middleware integration for state tracking
4. User identification and custom properties setup
5. Privacy settings and PII sanitization rules
6. Performance monitoring and Core Web Vitals tracking
7. Custom event tracking and conversion funnels
8. Error tracking integration (Sentry, Bugsnag)
9. Support workflow integration (Intercom, Zendesk)
10. Team access and session sharing setup

Additional context: [user privacy requirements, session volume expectations, compliance needs, existing analytics setup]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
