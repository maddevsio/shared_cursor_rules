I need to integrate New Relic for application performance monitoring and real user monitoring. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Tech stack: [e.g., React + Node.js, Next.js, Vue.js + Express, etc.]
- Monitoring scope: [frontend performance, backend APIs, database queries, external services]
- Performance tracking: [page load times, AJAX calls, user interactions, custom metrics]
- Error monitoring: [JavaScript errors, API failures, custom exceptions]
- User experience: [session tracking, conversion funnels, feature usage]
- Infrastructure: [server monitoring, containerized apps, serverless functions]
- Business metrics: [custom events, conversion tracking, A/B test results]

What I need:

1. New Relic account setup and license key configuration
2. Browser agent installation and configuration
3. SPA monitoring setup for single-page applications
4. Custom attribute and event tracking
5. Performance monitoring and alerting rules
6. Error tracking and custom error boundaries
7. User session tracking and identification
8. Custom dashboards and business metrics
9. Integration with backend APM monitoring
10. Mobile app monitoring setup (if applicable)

Additional context: [application architecture, performance goals, business KPIs, existing monitoring tools]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
