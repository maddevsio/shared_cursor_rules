I need to integrate Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Tech stack: [e.g., React + Node.js, Next.js, Vue.js + Express, etc.]
- Error tracking: [JavaScript errors, API errors, custom events, breadcrumbs]
- Performance monitoring: [page load times, API calls, database queries, custom transactions]
- Session replay: [user interactions, console logs, network requests, DOM changes]
- Release tracking: [deployment tracking, source maps, commit integration]
- Team setup: [team members, notification preferences, alert rules]
- Environment: [development, staging, production separation]
- Framework specific: [React error boundaries, Vue error handlers, custom integrations]

What I need:

1. Sentry project setup and DSN configuration
2. JavaScript SDK installation and initialization
3. Error boundary implementation for React/Vue
4. Performance monitoring setup (Core Web Vitals, custom metrics)
5. Session replay configuration and privacy settings
6. Source maps upload for production debugging
7. Custom error handling and context enrichment
8. Release and deployment tracking
9. Alert rules and notification setup
10. Team management and permission configuration

Additional context: [error volume expectations, privacy requirements, compliance needs, existing monitoring tools]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
