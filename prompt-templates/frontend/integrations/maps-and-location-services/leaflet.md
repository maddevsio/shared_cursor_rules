I need to implement Leaflet for interactive mapping. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Tech stack: [e.g., React + Node.js, Vue.js, vanilla JavaScript]
- Map providers: [OpenStreetMap, custom tiles, multiple sources]
- Interactivity: [markers, popups, drawing, editing, clustering]
- Data visualization: [GeoJSON layers, heatmaps, choropleth maps]
- Plugins needed: [routing, drawing, clustering, fullscreen, etc.]
- Custom features: [custom controls, animations, data binding]
- Performance: [large datasets, mobile optimization, smooth interactions]
- Styling: [custom markers, map themes, responsive design]

What I need:

1. Leaflet library setup and configuration
2. Multiple tile layer integration and switching
3. Advanced marker management and clustering
4. GeoJSON data loading and styling
5. Interactive drawing and editing tools
6. Custom controls and UI components
7. Plugin integration and configuration
8. Performance optimization techniques
9. Mobile-first responsive implementation
10. Data binding and state management

Additional context: [specific plugins, data sources, design requirements]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
