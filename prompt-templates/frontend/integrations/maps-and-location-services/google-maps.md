I need to integrate Google Maps Platform into my project. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Tech stack: [e.g., React + Node.js, Next.js, Vue.js, etc.]
- Map features needed: [basic map, markers, info windows, custom overlays]
- APIs required: [Places API, Directions, Geocoding, Distance Matrix, etc.]
- Use case: [store locator, delivery tracking, route planning, location picker]
- User interactions: [search places, get directions, location autocomplete]
- Data volume: [API calls per month, concurrent users]
- Mobile requirements: [responsive design, touch interactions, geolocation]
- Customization: [custom markers, map styling, branded experience]

What I need:

1. Google Cloud Console setup and API key configuration
2. Maps JavaScript API integration
3. Places API implementation (search, autocomplete)
4. Directions and routing functionality
5. Geocoding and reverse geocoding
6. Custom markers and info windows
7. Map styling and customization
8. Performance optimization and API quota management
9. Error handling and fallback strategies
10. Security best practices (API key restrictions)

Additional context: [specific features, existing Google services, budget considerations]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
