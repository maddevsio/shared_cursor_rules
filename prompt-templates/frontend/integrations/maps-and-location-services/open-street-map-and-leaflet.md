I need to integrate OpenStreetMap with Leaflet for mapping. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Tech stack: [e.g., React + Node.js, Vue.js, static site, etc.]
- Map requirements: [basic display, interactive features, custom markers]
- Data sources: [OSM data, custom GeoJSON, external APIs]
- Features needed: [search, routing, drawing, layer management]
- Tile servers: [OpenStreetMap, custom tiles, multiple providers]
- Use case: [community mapping, data visualization, location services]
- Offline capabilities: [tile caching, offline maps, PWA features]
- Customization: [custom markers, styling, plugins]

What I need:

1. Leaflet library setup and basic map configuration
2. OpenStreetMap tile layer integration
3. Custom marker and popup implementation
4. GeoJSON data loading and visualization
5. Search functionality (Nominatim integration)
6. Routing implementation (OSRM or similar)
7. Drawing and editing tools
8. Layer management and controls
9. Mobile optimization and responsive design
10. Plugin integration and customization

Additional context: [open-source requirements, specific OSM data needs, budget constraints]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
