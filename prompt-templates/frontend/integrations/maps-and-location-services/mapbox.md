I need to integrate Mapbox for mapping functionality. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Tech stack: [e.g., React + Node.js, Vue.js, vanilla JS, etc.]
- Map style: [default, custom design, satellite, terrain, navigation]
- Features needed: [interactive maps, markers, popups, drawing tools]
- APIs required: [Geocoding, Directions, Matrix, Isochrone, Static Images]
- Use case: [data visualization, route optimization, location analysis, real-time tracking]
- Customization level: [basic styling, fully custom map design, branded experience]
- Data sources: [GeoJSON, external APIs, real-time data feeds]
- Performance needs: [large datasets, smooth animations, mobile optimization]

What I need:

1. Mapbox account setup and access token configuration
2. Mapbox GL JS integration and basic map setup
3. Custom map styling (Mapbox Studio integration)
4. Data layer management (GeoJSON, vector tiles)
5. Interactive features (markers, popups, controls)
6. Geocoding and search functionality
7. Routing and navigation features
8. Performance optimization for large datasets
9. Mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
10. Analytics and usage monitoring

Additional context: [design requirements, data complexity, specific Mapbox features]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
