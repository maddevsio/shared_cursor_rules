I need to integrate Typesense into my project. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Tech stack: [e.g., React + Node.js, Vue.js, etc.]
- Deployment: [self-hosted, Typesense Cloud, Docker]
- Search requirements: [typo tolerance, faceting, geo search, etc.]
- Data volume: [approximate number of documents]
- Data structure: [simple objects, nested data, etc.]
- Performance needs: [search speed, indexing speed]

What I need:

1. Installation and initial setup
2. Collection schema design
3. Document indexing examples
4. Search implementation with UI
5. Advanced features (faceting, filtering, sorting)
6. Performance tuning guidelines
7. Error handling and best practices

Additional context: [any specific details about your implementation]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
