I need to integrate i18next for internationalization in my application. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Tech stack: [e.g., React + Node.js, Vue.js, Angular, vanilla JavaScript]
- Languages: [target languages, RTL support, fallback languages]
- Content types: [UI text, error messages, dynamic content, pluralization]
- Loading strategy: [lazy loading, namespace splitting, async loading]
- Storage: [localStorage, cookies, server-side, memory only]
- Detection: [URL path, subdomain, query parameter, browser language]
- Framework integration: [React, Vue, Angular, server-side rendering]
- Backend integration: [translation API, file loading, dynamic updates]

What I need:

1. i18next installation and basic configuration
2. Language detection and switching implementation
3. Translation file structure and organization
4. Namespace management and lazy loading
5. Pluralization and interpolation setup
6. Context-based translations
7. Number and date formatting
8. Missing translation handling
9. Development tools and debugging
10. Production optimization and caching

Additional context: [application size, number of languages, translation workflow, performance requirements]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
