I need to integrate Filestack for file uploads and processing. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- File sources: [local files, cloud storage, social media, camera]
- Processing needs: [image editing, video transcoding, document conversion]
- Upload volume: [concurrent uploads, file size limits]
- UI requirements: [custom picker, inline editing, mobile support]
- Security: [file validation, virus scanning, access control]

What I need:

1. API key setup and configuration
2. File picker implementation
3. Custom upload interface
4. File processing and transformation
5. Security and validation setup
6. Progress tracking and error handling
7. Mobile and responsive considerations
8. Performance optimization
9. Integration with backend systems

Additional context: [specific file types, processing requirements, existing infrastructure]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
