I need to integrate AWS S3 for file storage and delivery. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Tech stack: [e.g., React + Node.js, serverless, etc.]
- Upload method: [direct upload, presigned URLs, server-proxy]
- File types: [images, videos, documents, backups, etc.]
- Access patterns: [public, private, time-limited access]
- Volume: [storage size, transfer volume, concurrent uploads]
- CDN needs: [CloudFront integration, global delivery]
- Security: [IAM policies, bucket policies, encryption]
- Cost optimization: [storage classes, lifecycle policies]

What I need:

1. AWS account and S3 bucket setup
2. IAM roles and security configuration
3. Upload implementation (direct/presigned URLs)
4. File organization and naming strategies
5. CloudFront CDN integration
6. Security best practices
7. Cost optimization setup
8. Monitoring and logging
9. Error handling and retry mechanisms

Additional context: [existing AWS setup, compliance requirements, specific use cases]

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
