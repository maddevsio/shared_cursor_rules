I need to integrate Uploadcare for file handling and CDN delivery. Here are the details:

Project Details:

- Transformation needs: [image processing, video transcoding, document preview]
- Volume: [monthly uploads, storage requirements]

- Integration points: [forms, user profiles, content management]

What I need:

3. Custom upload UI implementation
4. File transformation and processing
5. CDN delivery optimization
6. Progress tracking and error handling
7. File management and organization
8. Security and validation setup
9. Performance optimization

Please provide a complete working example with detailed comments.
