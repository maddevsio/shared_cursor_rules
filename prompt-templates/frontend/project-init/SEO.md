Set up basic SEO configuration for the project including:
- Create a robots.txt file configured to allow or disallow appropriate paths for search engine crawling based on environment 
- Add Open Graph (OG) meta tags for social media link previews, including title, description, image, and URL. 
- Integrate OG tags dynamically into pages or the main HTML template to support dynamic content (for frameworks like Next.js, React Helmet, or Vue Meta).
