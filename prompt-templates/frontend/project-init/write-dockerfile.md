Create a production-ready Dockerfile for deploying the app:
- Using an official lightweight base image (e.g., node or alpine).
- Installing dependencies and building the project efficiently with multi-stage builds.
- Copying only necessary files to the final image to keep it small.
- Setting appropriate environment variables and exposing required ports.
- Carefully review the Dockerfile. Ensure it follows security best practices and has no performance issues.
