Analyze the [feature]:
- Describe what it does and its purpose in the product.
- Explain how it is implemented, including relevant components and logic.
- Highlight the differences between mobile and desktop implementations.
- Investigate related composables to understand supporting logic.

Then, write a **comprehensive internal document** that:
- Starts with a **summary section** tailored for non-technical stakeholders (focus on user experience, goals, and business value).
- Clearly explains the feature for engineers (include architecture, data flow, edge cases).

Rules you should always follow:
- Be detailed, well-structured, and use headings. 
- Avoid numbering for headers. 
- Avoid diagrams. 
- Avoid code snippets. 
- Reference the file names or function names. 
- Don't reference file path, just file name is enough.
- Wrap file names or function names with back ticks (`example.ts`)
